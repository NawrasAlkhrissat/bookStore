# ðŸ“š Library Management System (University Project)

This repository contains a simple web-based *Library Management System*, developed as part of a university course requirement. The system allows users to browse and reserve books, while administrators can manage book inventory and handle reservation requests.

> âš  *Note: This project was implemented using **PHP and MySQL* due to the course requirements, although my primary focus as a developer is *Full-Stack Web Development with Node.js and modern JavaScript frameworks*.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Summary

This application simulates the essential features of a basic library system. It offers a clear separation between user-facing functionality and administrative tools. Although quickly developed to meet academic deadlines, it serves as a strong representation of backend logic, database interaction, and system modeling in web development.

## ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

- This project was developed quickly for an academic course, so the *file structure and code organization are not production-ready*.
- Some *best practices (e.g. clean code, security validations)* may be missing due to time constraints.
- No authentication or user management is includedâ€”future versions could implement role-based access control.
- The project can serve as a *foundation for future refactoring, or a **blueprint to be rebuilt using Node.js/Express and MongoDB* in alignment with my current tech stack.

## ðŸ”§ Possible Improvements (Future Work)

- Refactor to follow MVC design pattern.
- Implement user login and authentication.
- Apply modern UI/UX practices.
- Add pagination/search/filtering to book listings.
- Rebuild the project using Node.js and Express.js for backend.
